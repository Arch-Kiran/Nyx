# CLIFM — CLI File Manager

> **"Your desktop died. Your files didn't. CLIFM keeps you moving."**

A zero-dependency, ASCII-art file manager for the terminal. Built for Linux users who live without a desktop environment — Kali, Arch, servers, chroots, Termux on Android — anywhere a GUI file manager is absent, broken, or simply not needed.

## View Modes

### Icon Grid (default)

5-line ASCII art icons in a grid. Each file type has a distinct icon and color.

```
┌─────────┐    ┌───────┐    ┌──┬──────┐    ┌───────┐
│         │    │ .___. │    │▓▓│      │    │ .___. │

│         │    │       │    │▓▓│      │    │       │
└─────────┘    └───────┘    └──┴──────┘    └───────┘
  projects       main.py     backup.zip    report.pdf
```

### List View

One item per row with permissions, size, and date. Selected item name turns bold green.

```
  1   [DIR]  projects          rwxr-xr-x    <DIR>  2026-04-10 18:55
  2   [.PY]  main.py           rw-r--r--   12.8 KB  2026-04-10 20:01
  3   [ZIP]  backup.zip        rw-r--r--  892.0 KB  2026-04-08 09:33
```

Press `V` to toggle between both views.

| `M` → `N` | Bookmark any path with Tab completion |
| `M` → `D` | Delete a bookmark |
| `M` → number | Navigate to that bookmark instantly |

### Search Menu — press `/` or `F`

| Option | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `1` | Filter current directory by filename |
| `2` | Deep recursive search from current directory |
| `3` | Jump to path with Tab completion |
| `4` | Clear active filter |
| `5` | Find — searches `~/` first, asks to expand systemwide |
| `6` | Open Trash bin |

Search results show 7 at a time. `↑` / `↓` to page, number + Enter to navigate.

### View and Sort

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `V` | Toggle icon grid / list view |
| `T` | Cycle sort mode |
| `.` | Toggle hidden files |
| `F5` | Refresh |
| `?` | Help screen |
| `Q` | Quit |

**Sort modes:** Name↑ → Name↓ → Size↑ → Size↓ → Time↑ → Time↓ → Ext

---

## Go to Path — G

Press `G`. Completions appear in real time as you type:

```
  Go to Path  Type path, Tab=complete, Enter=go, Esc=cancel, Ctrl+U=clear

  > ~/pro
    projects/
    programs/
```

Tab fills the longest common prefix. One match auto-completes fully. `~` expansion supported.

---

## Trash Bin

Press `B` on any file or folder to move it to `~/.local/share/Trash/files`.

Access trash browser via `/` → `6`:

```
  Trash  /home/kira/.local/share/Trash/files

     1  [FILE]  oldreport.pdf     2.3 KB
     2  [DIR]   backup-folder
     3  [FILE]  config.json       1.1 KB

  [number] + Enter  → Restore that item
  RA               → Restore ALL
  D[number]        → Permanently delete item  e.g. D3
  DA               → Permanently delete ALL trash
  O                → Navigate into trash folder in CLIFM
  Q or Enter       → Close
```

When restoring, CLIFM asks where to put the files:

```
  Restore to where?
  1. Restored folder  (~/Restored — created if needed)
  2. Type a path       (Tab to complete)
  Q. Cancel
```

Option 1 collects everything into `~/Restored/` — home directory stays clean. Option 2 lets you Tab-complete any destination path.

---

## Bookmarks

Press `M`:

```
  Bookmarks / Shortcuts  (stored inside clifm.py)

     1.  myproject          /home/kira/projects/clifm
     2.  configs            /etc/nginx

  A. Add current directory
  N. Add custom path
  D. Delete a bookmark
  Enter/Q. Cancel
```

Type a number to jump to that path instantly. Bookmarks are written into the `_BOOKMARKS_DATA` line inside `clifm.py` — zero external files, zero config directories, fully self-contained.

---

## Bulk Rename

Mark multiple files with `Space`, press `R`. Your editor opens with one filename per line. Edit names, save, close. CLIFM renames every file whose name changed. Unchanged lines are skipped. Conflicts are reported.

---

## Find — Two-Stage Search

Press `/` → `5`:

```
  Find: fonts

  Searching ~/ ...
  Found 3 result(s) in ~/

  Also search the full system?  (finds outside ~/, takes longer)
  Expand to full system? [y/N]:
```

Found in `~/` — shows results and asks to expand. Nothing in `~/` — goes full system automatically. Skips `/proc` `/sys` `/dev` `/run` `/snap`. Ctrl+C aborts cleanly.

---

## Compression

Press `Z` on any file, folder, or selection of marked items:

| Format | Requires |
|--------|---------|
| `.zip` `.tar` `.tar.gz` `.tar.bz2` `.tar.xz` `.gz` `.bz2` `.xz` | Python built-in — always works |
| `.7z` | `7z` binary — CLIFM offers to install |
| `.zst` | `zstd` binary — CLIFM offers to install |

---

## File Opening

Press `Enter` on any file:

| Type | Tools tried in order |
|------|---------------------|
| Text / code / config | nvim → vim → nano → micro → bat → less → raw output |


---

## Edge Cases Handled

- Directory deleted while inside it — walks up to nearest existing parent automatically
- File deleted between listing and opening — reports it, does not crash
- Permission denied on directory — shows empty, does not crash
- Broken symlinks — shown correctly, does not crash
- Cursor out of range after delete — clamped to last valid item
- Marks pointing to deleted files — removed before each operation
- Clipboard items deleted before paste — reports missing, pastes the rest
- Rename to existing name — reports conflict, no overwrite
- Archive extraction failure — reports error, does not crash
- Search on huge directories — Ctrl+C aborts cleanly at any point

---

## Termux / Android

Detected automatically. Never uses sudo. Uses `pkg install` or `apt install` directly. All operations work identically.

---

## Technical Notes

- Pure Python stdlib — no pip, one file
- `os.read(fd, 1)` directly on the kernel fd — bypasses all Python buffering layers
- `termios` / `tty` / `select()` for reliable raw single-keypress input
- Bookmarks written into `_BOOKMARKS_DATA` line inside `clifm.py` on save
- Navigation history — 50-entry deque, back and forward
- Clipboard survives directory changes
- Trash follows XDG spec — `~/.local/share/Trash/files`
- Marks cleaned automatically before every operation

---
